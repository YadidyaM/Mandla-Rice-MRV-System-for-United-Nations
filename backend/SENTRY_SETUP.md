# Sentry Integration Setup

## 🚀 What's Been Added

Your backend now has full Sentry integration for error monitoring, performance tracking, and debugging.

## 📋 Files Created/Modified

- `src/config/sentry.ts` - Sentry configuration and initialization
- `src/middleware/sentry.ts` - Sentry middleware for Express
- `src/routes/health.routes.ts` - Added Sentry test endpoint
- `src/index.ts` - Integrated Sentry middleware and error handling
- `package.json` - Added @sentry/node dependency
- `test-sentry.js` - Simple test script to verify Sentry

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. Set Environment Variable
Add this to your `.env` file:
```bash
SENTRY_DSN="https://fc14bb90babb5f719e7263d8a15f7d5e@o4509882022756352.ingest.us.sentry.io/4509882053296128"
```

### 3. Test Sentry Integration

#### Option A: Test Script
```bash
cd backend
node test-sentry.js
```

#### Option B: Test via API
Start your server and visit:
```
GET /health/test-sentry
```

## 🎯 What Sentry Now Monitors

- **Error Tracking**: All unhandled errors and exceptions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Request tracing and response times
- **Request Context**: URL, method, user agent, IP address
- **User Context**: User ID when available
- **Custom Events**: Manual error capture with context

## 🔍 Sentry Dashboard

Visit your Sentry dashboard to see:
- Real-time error reports
- Performance metrics
- User impact analysis
- Stack traces and context
- Error trends and patterns

## 🚨 Error Handling Flow

1. **Request comes in** → Sentry request handler
2. **Routes execute** → Sentry tracing handler
3. **Error occurs** → Sentry captures exception
4. **Error handler** → Sentry error handler processes
5. **Response sent** → Error ID included in response

## 🧪 Testing Endpoints

- `/health` - Basic health check (filtered from Sentry)
- `/health/detailed` - Detailed health check
- `/health/test-sentry` - **Test Sentry error capture**

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

Sentry automatically tracks:
- Request/response times
- Database query performance
- External API calls
- Memory usage patterns

## 🔒 Security Features

- Health check endpoints filtered from Sentry
- Sensitive data not captured
- Rate limiting respected
- Environment-based configuration

## 🚀 Production Deployment

For production, ensure:
- `NODE_ENV=production` is set
- Sentry DSN is properly configured
- Error sampling rate is appropriate (0.1 = 10%)
- Performance monitoring is enabled

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test the integration** using the test endpoints
2. **Monitor your Sentry dashboard** for errors
3. **Set up alerts** for critical errors
4. **Configure team notifications** in Sentry
5. **Set up frontend Sentry** for complete monitoring

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If Sentry isn't working:
1. Check your `.env` file has `SENTRY_DSN`
2. Verify `@sentry/node` is installed
3. Check console logs for Sentry initialization
4. Test with the simple test script first
5. Verify your Sentry DSN is correct

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your Express backend now has enterprise-grade error monitoring and performance tracking with Sentry!
